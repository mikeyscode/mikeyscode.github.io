On title alone I would think I was a little crazy myself, but I'll hold my hands up and be honest I have lied to you a tiny bit. Although the Facebook group is a huge part of it I do also get more than just that for my £38 a month such as;

            I have made a lot of investments into myself - financial and otherwise, but if I could choose one of those investments as the one that made the biggest change to my lifestyle it would be an easy choice. I started working with my personal trainer Alex in April 2019, since then I have been working with him consistently to improve my health and fitness.
