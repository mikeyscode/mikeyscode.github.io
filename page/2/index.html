        <div class="content">
            I have made a lot of investments into myself - financial and otherwise, but if I could choose one of those investments as the one that made the biggest change to my lifestyle it would be an easy choice. I started working with my personal trainer Alex in April 2019, since then I have been working with him consistently to improve my health and fitness. So I thought I would share some of the key benefits I have seen during that time;

        <div class="content">
            I have honestly lost track of how many years it has been since I made the switch to only drinking water. The only time I break that rule is when alcohol is involved and I am out for drinks with friends. A lot of people profess the magic of water and how everyone should drink more so I wanted to give my experience on how it affected myself and also cover a few tips on how you could make the switch yourselves.

        <div class="content">
            Go's implicit interfaces provide great flexibility when it comes to testing our applications. By satisfying the expected contract we can create mocks easily to be used within our test cases. For me there are two main approaches I personally take to mocking.
Lightweight Mocking I call this lightweight as it is less involved than the method we will come onto next. It basically involves just creating a new structure which satisfies the interface.
